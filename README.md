# Bosse-GSM-bot
A project for testing a GSM module for my Raspberry pi. Very shaky code and should be viewed as a work in progress.. but put it here and maybe someone will find it useful :)

BosseSMSbot is what you already guessed, the bot handling the GSM part or the project and BosseSlackbot was for having a bot in our channel on Slack to interact with. We don't use slack anymore, but as stated earlier, it might be handy for other people.
The ide was that you would SMS bosse with a request, food recipies in my case, and bosse would respond with a list of foods.

Not very efficient and it would cost a little for every SMS, but it sounded like fun to do and it was :)
